# Rustlings Solutions

## About

This repository contains my solutions to the [Rustlings exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), a project designed to help new Rustaceans learn Rust. Completing these exercises demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of basic and advanced Rust concepts.

## My Rust Journey

I complete the Rustlings exercises around every six months to ensure my Rust skills remain sharp and up-to-date. This routine helps me stay familiar with Rust syntax, idiomatic practices, and the language's evolving features.

### Progress Timeline

- **2020**: Learned C# and Haskell, laying the foundation in functional and object-oriented programming concepts.
- **2021**: Read "The Rust Programming Language" book and completed Rustlings for the first time, marking the start of my journey with Rust.
- **2021 - Present**: Continued to work on Rust projects, routinely redoing Rustlings every six months to stay sharp on Rust syntax and idiomatic practices.

## Other Rust Projects

In addition to Rustlings, I actively work on various Rust projects, ranging from web applications using Actix-web to systems programming. These projects can be found here: on my github.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Fundamental Rust syntax and concepts
- Error handling and pattern matching
- Use of smart pointers and concurrency
- Development of CLI applications and use of Cargo
- Writing idiomatic Rust code and following best practices

## Learning and Development

Rust is a constantly evolving language, and I am committed to ongoing learning and improvement. Completing Rustlings and engaging in new projects allows me to:

- Stay updated with the latest Rust features and ecosystem changes.
- Continuously improve code quality through refactoring and adopting new paradigms.
- Challenge myself with advanced exercises and projects.
